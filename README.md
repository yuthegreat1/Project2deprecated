# Project Proposal
Our client has an exciting new meat substitute being prepared for market. The product is an excellent substitute for America’s favorite white meat, chicken. As part of the marketing rollout our client would like Huddle Analytical to create a database of chicken recipes to draw from as they promote their product. The clients parameters are flexible, but they must include chicken as the primary protein. Other possible parameters are preparation time and number of ingredients.
